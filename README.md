## Description
**install_pivariety_pkgs.sh**
Now supports the mainstream bullseye
### Things to do
1. camera_i2c tool needs to be updated, or not, but **gpio** this function has been officially abandoned (solved)
2. rpi3-gpiovirtbuf needs to be differentiated between 32-bit and 64-bit (solved)

### There are problems (can be optimized later)
1. temporarily does not support CM3,4, etc.
2. imx519 downspeed temporarily no kernel version below 5.17
